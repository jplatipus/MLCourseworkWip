accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, training error, test error, timing, AUC. 
Could also indicate e.g. best k-fold cross val. model of the method used (with parameter values, kFoldLoss, elapsed time).

If you decide to visualise confusion matrices, it is important and sufficient to present them for testing data (same for ROC curves).

You can also include hyperparameter optimisation graphs in your poster.
